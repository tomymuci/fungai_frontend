                    Soak for 20 minutes. Carefully lift the mushrooms from the liquid and pick through
                    them to remove any foreign debris. Chop the mushrooms, Strain the soaking liquid
                    through a colander lined with paper towels. Reserve the porcini mushrooms and the
                    strained soaking liquid separately.</li>

                    <li>Add the chopped porcini mushrooms, salt, and pepper to the pan and cook for 2 minutes.
                    Add the porcini soaking liquid and simmer briskly until the liquid has been reduced
                    by half, about 10 minutes. The sauce should no longer be soupy, but don't reduce
                    the sauce so much that the pan becomes dry.</li>
                    <li>Stir the cream into the pan and simmer just until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.
                    Taste for salt and pepper and adjust the seasonings if necessary.</li>
